# Vehicle Control System

## Description

The Vehicle Control System is a C programming mini project that offers a simulation of a real-world vehicle control scenario. The project provides users with the ability to interact with a virtual vehicle, adjusting various parameters and observing how the system responds.

In this simulation, the user takes on the role of a vehicle operator, making decisions to turn the engine on/off, set the traffic light color, and control temperature-related functions. The system closely mimics the behavior of a vehicle's sensors and controllers, providing an educational and engaging experience for those interested in understanding how these components interact.

## Features

- **Engine Control:** Turn on and off the vehicle engine at will.
- **Traffic Light Simulation:** Set the traffic light color to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Temperature Regulation:** Adjust room temperature and observe the effects on the AC and Engine Temperature Controller.
- **Bonus Feature:** Conditional compilation based on the `WITH_ENGINE_TEMP_CONTROLLER` directive, providing an advanced option to toggle the Engine Temperature Controller functionality.
